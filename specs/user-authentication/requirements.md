# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Authentication System is the foundational security layer for the Nexus Trading Platform. This system implements a hybrid authentication strategy using JWT access tokens stored in memory and httpOnly refresh tokens stored in secure cookies to enable secure cross-domain communication between the Vercel-hosted frontend (HTTPS) and AWS EC2-hosted backend (HTTP). The system provides user registration, login, logout, and profile management capabilities while maintaining security best practices for a distributed trading platform.

## Frontend Requirements (Nexus-FE)

### FE-1: User Registration Interface

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for a trading account through an intuitive form, so that I can access the Nexus trading platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the frontend SHALL display a form with fields for email, password, confirm password, and full name
2. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the frontend SHALL validate email format and password strength client-side before sending to backend
3. WHEN the backend returns validation errors THEN the frontend SHALL display specific error messages next to relevant form fields
4. WHEN registration is successful THEN the frontend SHALL store the access token in memory and redirect to the dashboard
5. WHEN registration fails THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages without exposing sensitive details

### FE-2: User Login Interface

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into my account through a secure login form, so that I can access my trading dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the frontend SHALL display a form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the frontend SHALL store the received access token in memory (not localStorage)
3. WHEN login is successful THEN the frontend SHALL redirect the user to their dashboard
4. WHEN login fails THEN the frontend SHALL display a generic error message without revealing specific failure reasons
5. WHEN the login form is submitted THEN the frontend SHALL include credentials in the request to enable httpOnly cookie setting

### FE-3: Automatic Token Refresh

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to automatically refresh, so that I can continue trading without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request returns 401 (token expired) THEN the frontend SHALL automatically attempt token refresh
2. WHEN token refresh is successful THEN the frontend SHALL retry the original request with the new token
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the frontend SHALL clear authentication state and redirect to login
4. WHEN the user is active THEN the frontend SHALL proactively refresh tokens before expiration (25-minute mark)
5. WHEN multiple requests fail simultaneously THEN the frontend SHALL prevent multiple refresh attempts

### FE-4: Logout Functionality

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to securely log out, so that my session is properly terminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the frontend SHALL call the backend logout endpoint
2. WHEN logout is initiated THEN the frontend SHALL immediately clear the in-memory access token
3. WHEN logout completes THEN the frontend SHALL redirect to the login page
4. WHEN logout fails THEN the frontend SHALL still clear local authentication state and redirect to login
5. WHEN the user closes the browser THEN the in-memory token SHALL be automatically cleared

### FE-5: Profile Management Interface

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view and update my profile, so that I can maintain accurate account information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the frontend SHALL display current profile information in an editable form
2. WHEN a user updates profile information THEN the frontend SHALL validate changes client-side before submission
3. WHEN profile update is successful THEN the frontend SHALL display a success message and update the displayed information
4. WHEN profile update fails THEN the frontend SHALL display specific error messages
5. WHEN updating password THEN the frontend SHALL require current password confirmation

### FE-6: Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a user navigating the platform, I want consistent authentication state, so that protected routes are properly secured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a protected route without authentication THEN the frontend SHALL redirect to login
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the frontend SHALL allow access to protected routes
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the frontend SHALL update the UI accordingly (show/hide login/logout buttons)
4. WHEN the app initializes THEN the frontend SHALL attempt to refresh tokens to restore authentication state
5. WHEN network requests fail due to authentication THEN the frontend SHALL handle errors gracefully

## Backend Requirements (Nexus-BE)

### BE-1: User Registration API

**User Story:** As a system, I want to securely register new users, so that they can access the trading platform with proper authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a registration request is received THEN the backend SHALL validate email format, password strength, and required fields
2. WHEN a user registers with an existing email THEN the backend SHALL return a 409 conflict error
3. WHEN registration data is valid THEN the backend SHALL hash the password using bcrypt and store the user in PostgreSQL
4. WHEN registration is successful THEN the backend SHALL generate JWT access token and httpOnly refresh cookie
5. WHEN registration fails THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate error codes without exposing internal details

### BE-2: User Authentication API

**User Story:** As a system, I want to authenticate users securely, so that only authorized users can access trading features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login credentials are received THEN the backend SHALL verify email and password against stored hash
2. WHEN credentials are valid THEN the backend SHALL generate a JWT access token with 30-minute expiration
3. WHEN login is successful THEN the backend SHALL set httpOnly refresh cookie with 7-day expiration and secure attributes
4. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN the backend SHALL return 401 error without revealing which credential was wrong
5. WHEN login attempts exceed rate limits THEN the backend SHALL temporarily block the IP address

### BE-3: Token Refresh API

**User Story:** As a system, I want to refresh expired tokens, so that users can maintain continuous sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a refresh request is received with valid httpOnly cookie THEN the backend SHALL generate a new access token
2. WHEN refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the backend SHALL clear the refresh cookie and return 401
3. WHEN refresh is successful THEN the backend SHALL return new access token with fresh 30-minute expiration
4. WHEN refresh token is used THEN the backend SHALL optionally rotate the refresh token for enhanced security
5. WHEN refresh fails THEN the backend SHALL log the security event for monitoring

### BE-4: Logout API

**User Story:** As a system, I want to properly terminate user sessions, so that logout is secure and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logout request is received THEN the backend SHALL invalidate the current access token

3. WHEN logout is processed THEN the backend SHALL add the token to a blacklist (Redis) until expiration
4. WHEN logout completes THEN the backend SHALL return success confirmation
