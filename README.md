# Nexus Trading Platform - Project Definition

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: Nexus  
**Type**: Real-Time Stock Trading Simulator Platform  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive learning project to master full-stack development with advanced technologies while building a portfolio-worthy trading simulator

**Repository Structure**:
- `NexusFE`: Frontend repository (Vercel deployment)
- `NexusBE`: Backend repository (AWS deployment)

---

## Frontend Architecture (NexusFE)

### Technology Stack:
- **Framework**: NextJS with TypeScript
- **UI**: React components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Context API or Zustand
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **API Communication**: REST/GraphQL to backend services

### Deployment:
- **Platform**: Vercel (FREE tier)
- **Features**: Auto-deployment, preview environments, edge network
- **Access**: `https://nexus-app.vercel.app`
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions integration

---

## Backend Architecture (NexusBE)

### Technology Stack:
- **Framework**: NestJS microservices with TypeScript
- **Communication**: 
  - gRPC for synchronous service-to-service calls
  - Apache Kafka for asynchronous event-driven messaging
  - WebSockets for real-time client updates
- **API Gateway**: REST/GraphQL to gRPC conversion
- **Contracts**: Protocol Buffers for service definitions

### Microservices:
1. **API Gateway** - Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
2. **User Management** - Authentication, profiles, preferences  
3. **Trading Service** - Orders, executions, trade history
4. **Portfolio Service** - Holdings, valuations, performance analytics
5. **Market Data Service** - Price generation, historical data
6. **Notification Service** - Real-time alerts, WebSocket management
7. **Analytics Service** - Performance metrics, insights
8. **Leaderboard Service** - Rankings, competitions
9. **Real-time Engine** - Live updates, order book streaming

### Event Architecture:
**Kafka Topics**: `order.created`, `order.executed`, `price.updated`, `portfolio.updated`, `user.notifications`, `market.events`

---

## Database Strategy

### PostgreSQL (AWS RDS):
- User data, authentication, trading records, portfolios
- Single instance with multiple schemas per service

### MongoDB Atlas:
- Market data, analytics, logs, time-series data
- 512MB free tier cluster

### Redis (AWS ElastiCache):
- Caching, sessions, real-time data, leaderboards
- Single node shared across services

---

## Deployment Plan

### AWS Infrastructure (FREE Tier):
- **EC2**: t3.micro instance running Docker Compose
- **RDS**: PostgreSQL db.t3.micro
- **ElastiCache**: Redis cache.t3.micro
- **S3**: Static assets and logs (5GB free)
- **CloudWatch**: Basic monitoring and logs

### Container Orchestration:
- **Docker Compose**: All services on single EC2 instance
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy, load balancing, static file serving
- **Kafka + Zookeeper**: Event streaming infrastructure

### CI/CD Pipeline:
- **GitHub Actions**: Build, test, deploy automation
- **ECR**: Docker image registry (if needed)
- **Deployment**: Automated on merge to main branch

### Access Strategy:
- **Frontend**: Vercel subdomain (HTTPS)
- **Backend**: EC2 public IP (HTTP for learning)
- **Cost**: $0/month for first year using free tiers

---

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### Performance:
- Support 1000+ concurrent users (simulated)
- Sub-100ms response times for trading operations
- Real-time price updates with minimal latency
- High-throughput message processing with Kafka

### Scalability:
- Microservices architecture for horizontal scaling
- Database optimization for high-volume data
- Caching strategies with Redis
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

### Reliability:
- Service-to-service communication patterns
- Error handling and circuit breakers
- Data consistency across microservices
- System health monitoring and alerting

### Security:
- JWT-based authentication
- Service-to-service authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Basic security best practices

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Monitoring & Observability:
- AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure metrics
- NGINX access logs for request tracking
- Custom performance dashboards
- Real-time system health monitoring

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for individual services
- Integration tests for service communication
- Load testing with simulated concurrent users
- End-to-end testing for critical user flows

### Data Management:
- No external data dependencies
- Realistic fake data generation
- Database migrations and versioning
- Data backup and recovery strategies

### Development Workflow:
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Feature branch workflow with PR reviews
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Environment parity (dev/staging/prod)

---

## Simulation & Load Testing

### Built-in Simulation Services:
- **AI Market Simulator**: Realistic stock price movements
- **Bot Trading Army**: Multiple trading strategies and behaviors
- **Market Events Generator**: Volatility events and news impacts
- **Concurrent User Simulation**: Load testing with realistic patterns

### Performance Validation:
- Real-time performance dashboards
- Bottleneck identification and resolution
- Load testing reports and metrics
- System behavior under stress analysis
